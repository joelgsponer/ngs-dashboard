Hello,\n
This App was created by me in January 2014. It is based on the parameters calculated by Peter Hartmann 
and Lukas Schüpach in 1993 for creating Pathostat 1.
In November 2014, I additionally decided to also include some functions to calculate and store the data 
obtained from fetal autopsies. 
These parameters are derived from:
Archie et al., 
'Quantitative Standards for Fetal and neonatal Autopsy' 
American Journal of Clinical Pathology 2006. 
DOI:10.1309/FK9D5WBA1UEPT5BB

If you encounter any problems using this app, do not hesitate to contact me.
\n
Best 

Joël
